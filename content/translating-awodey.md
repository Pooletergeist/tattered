# Why do it?
Chapter 1 is great, after a semester course in category theory.
Tons of info. Cayley representation of Categories is cool once you get Yoneda,
or slice. Slice is cool once Yoneda. So much so fast. Could be awesome if you
THINK about the first-time reader's mind. No reference for a category, or even
the abstract structures. 

Example - pg. 21 "no identities... empty path will be the identity..."

# Need for me translating:
- diagramming capacity. 
- foldability/linking/boxes 'think about it'

# Needed opening concepts interleaved
1. Learning to think Visually
    Categories as bubbles. Functors squishing categories. 
2. Trusting Notation. Abstraction barriers. Drawing arrows & source-targets
3. Reassurance, intuition comes with time. cmd-f delete 'just', 'of course'

## maybe?
Posets, visually. Monoids, visually.
Spell-out the steps.
what should be checked, what shouldn't.
