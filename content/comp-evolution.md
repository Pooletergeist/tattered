# Memory Capacity of the Human Brain

## How many neurons?
[86 million, by soup extrapolation](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/brain-metrics/are_there_really_as_many/)
[editorial by method author](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1201895109)

*Not Straightforward* [past methods criticism](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07923.x) [^bignote]

## How many synapses?
[164 x 10^12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syn.1083)

## 74 terabytes in the cerebral cortex

cites:
[4.7 bits of info per synapse](https://elifesciences.org/articles/10778)
and [125 trillion synapses in cerebral cortex](https://elifesciences.org/articles/10778)

## Where does this 2.5 petabytes number come from?
Scientific American. No citation or calculation revealed. Ostensibly due to
