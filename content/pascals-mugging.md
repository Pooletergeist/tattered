## Act 0, Scene 0: the lobby
*PASCAL paces back-and-forth across lobby of “Tech Company."
Enter MUGGER in fleece vest and khaki shorts.*

PASCAL: Why am I here? I died at least a couple years ago.

MUGGER: I AM YAHWEH, ONE TRUE GOD. IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME $1, I WILL DESTROY THE UNIVERSE. 

PASCAL: Ok, pretty low chance that's true. But it would be really bad if you
destroyed the universe. Perhaps infinitely bad. And $1 isn’t that much. So I’ll give you $1.

MUGGER: I AM YAHWEH, ONE TRUE GOD. IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME $1, I WILL DESTROY THE UNIVERSE. 

PASCAL: I already gave you a dollar.

MUGGER: I AM YAHWEH, ONE TRUE GOD. IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME $1, I WILL DESTROY THE UNIVERSE. ALSO, CHINA GAVE ME A DOLLAR

PASCAL: … seriously dude?

MUGGER: I AM YAHWEH, ONE TRUE GOD. IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME $1, I WILL DESTROY THE UNIVERSE.

PASCAL: I guess it would still be infinitely bad. And $1 still isn't that much.

MUGGER: I AM YAHWEH, ONE TRUE GOD. IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME $1, I WILL DESTROY THE
UNIVERSE. PLUS, YOU ALREADY GAME ME A DOLLAR, SO I MUST BE CREDIBLE

PASCAL: I'm not having fun anymore.

## The immoral of the story
- For quantum, replace DESTROY THE UNIVERSE with "enact Q-DAY".
- For AI, replace DESTROY THE UNIVERSE with "make AI that kills Humanity".

Note: I'm *not* saying there aren't good reasons to fund post-quantum cryptography or AI safety. I *am* saying we should separate those arguments from bad but persuasive rhetoric.
